      russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea on 24

    <p>
      I have my own small donation company, which you can find
      <Anchor text="here" href="https://zrzutka.pl/pthyet" />. Once per month I
      am buying holographic sights, starlinks and other tactical equipment.

      If you don't trust the link I have provided, it is ok. You can also make a
      donation to these most popular charity foundations in Ukraine:
